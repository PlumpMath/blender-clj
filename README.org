* Motivation

I want to write scripts for blender in clojure. Instead of runnning blender
in headless mode, I want the GUI visible while I run scripts.

* Procedure

We need "bpy.so" to be built from the blender project. We will patch blender to run the GUI in the foreground, while still building "bpy.so".

The build has been tested on:

- Fedora 31

* Building

"bpy.so" can be build from the patched blender source as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./build-blender-fedora.sh
#+END_SRC

* Testing

Open a clojure repl with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./build-blender-fedora.sh repl
#+END_SRC

Run the demo:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require 'blender-clj.examples.cube)

(blender-clj.examples.cube/demo)
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, a repl can be loaded as follows, where BPY_BIN_PATH is the directory where bpy.so can be found.

#+BEGIN_SRC
BPY_BIN_PATH=vendor/blender-git/build_linux/bin clj -r
#+END_SRC
