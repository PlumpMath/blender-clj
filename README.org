* Motivation

To script blender through libpython-clj, while the blender GUI is visible.

* Procedure

The python shared libary "bpy.so" is build from the blender project. The blender source code is patched with minimal
changes to allow the GUI to be loaded into the foreground from the shared library.

The build has been tested on:

- fedora 31

* Building
