* Motivation

To script blender through libpython-clj, while the blender GUI is visible.

* Procedure

The python shared libary "bpy.so" is build from the blender project. The blender source code is patched with minimal
changes to allow the GUI to be loaded into the foreground from the shared library.

The build has been tested on:

- fedora 31

* Building

In order to call blender from python, the python c library "bpy.so" has to be built:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./build-blender-fedora.sh
#+END_SRC

* Testing

Open a clojure repl with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./build-blender-fedora.sh repl
#+END_SRC

Run the demo:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require 'blender-clj.examples.cube)

(blender-clj.examples.cube/demo)
#+END_SRC
