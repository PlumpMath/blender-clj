* Description

This project uses libpython-clj and a custom build of blender as a python module, to be able to load it
in my clojure repl and script it with the GUI visible, all from clojure.

* Motivation

I want to script blender with clojure from cider/emacs, or CLI, etc. I want the GUI to be visible.

* Procedure

We need blender to be built as the python module "bpy.so", but patched to run the GUI in the foreground.

The build has been tested on:

- Fedora 31 (python 3.7.7, blender 2.83)

* Building

"bpy.so" can be built from the patched blender source as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./build-blender-fedora.sh
#+END_SRC

See https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Building_Blender/Linux/Fedora for more details regarding dependencies.

* Running

To get blender running on the main thread and nrepl in the background, run the following, after which
you can jack-in with your favourite editor.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
clj -A:nREPL
#+END_SRC

* Demo

After building, open a clojure repl with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./build-blender-fedora.sh repl
#+END_SRC

Run the demo:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require 'blender-clj.examples.cube)

(blender-clj.examples.cube/demo)
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, a repl can be loaded as follows, where BPY_BIN_PATH is the directory where bpy.so can be found.

#+BEGIN_SRC
BPY_BIN_PATH=vendor/blender-git/build_linux/bin clj -r
#+END_SRC
